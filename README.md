This repository has:
Scrivener, a simple program that takes user input to form a story.
ShipSim, a ship simulator using a 2d array. 
CheatSheet, gives an exemplary use of various statements that can be used for managing arrays.

## Why I made this.
I made this as a way to practice using Java statements that beginners would not be familiar with (like switch and String.format) to prevent the "Oh, you can do that?" moment.
